Friends,

Forgive me for missing the newsletter last month, and the very chaotic and short one coming in this month. 

I have truthfully been completely and totally burnt out, and when not making comics, scraping what little time I can towards other hobbies to feel as though there is some free/relax time in my life.

BUT, I'm sending this to you because I have one big festival coming up this weekend, and TCAF in a couple more weeks. Read ahead for more info!

## Comics
The Death of Baba Yaga chapter 2 is done! Printed and everything. It's shorter than Chapter 1, which feels a little weird, but it's good as writers to not get stuck in this trap that each instalment should be longer than the last-- readers can sense filler [^1].

## Festivals 
I've got two major festivals coming up.

### Montreal May 23rd-25th
The [Montreal Comic Arts Festival](https://www.fbdm-mcaf.ca/en/) is THIS weekend (May 23rd-25th). I will be at tent E40 near St Denis and Gilford. It is a free, outdoor festival, so come check it out! Buy some of my comics and/or bring me an iced coffee the size of space.

### Toronto June 7th + 8th
Shortly after that, you can find me at the [Toronto Comic Arts Festival](https://www.torontocomics.com/), June 7th and 8th at the Toronto MetropolitanÂ Universityâ€™s **Mattamy Athletic Centre**Â  (50 Carlton St).

### What will I have there?

These two photos of my previous setup give you a good idea. But for some specifics:
- The 2nd printing of Preying Mantis!! My erotic thriller comic about a female serial killer murdering tech dudes and finding love along the way.
- The Death of Baba Yaga chapter 2!! Continuing my gothic western re-telling of Vasilisa the Beautiful.
- Risograph prints! Some Bloodborne inspired prints, and a Gale Dekarios from Baldur's Gate 3.
- Lots of stickers! Mostly Baldur's Gate, but also some femme fatale themed ones.
- Some other small prints and maybe some bookmarks. Who knows! I go kind of insane right before festivals and think about making a bunch of stuff and tiring myself out ðŸ˜…

## Recommendations
I definitely have way more recommendations, but so little time, so for now, [I leave you with this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=989EROVu110), which is so beautiful it makes me cry.

I promise to have more next newsletter!!!
